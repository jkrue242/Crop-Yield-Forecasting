# Forecasting Crop Yields
Supervised machine learning project for Applied Machine Learning, spring 2024

Comparative study between neural network models:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
- Gated Recurrent Unit Networks (GRUs)

# Time Series Clustering
Self Organized Maps (SOM) and K-Means clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as the distance metric and silhouette score as a validation metric and stopping condition
